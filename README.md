# Base64 Image Transformer and Decoder
## Overview
The Base64 Image Transformer and Decoder is a standalone executable application that enables you to encode and decode images using Base64 encoding with customizable Caesar cipher shifts. The tool allows for multiple transformations based on user-provided seeds. It is designed to handle images and apply transformations based on specified positions and shifts in the Base64 string.

## Features
Encode Images: Convert images to Base64 encoding with customizable Caesar cipher shifts.
Decode Images: Reverse the transformation and decode the Base64 string back to its original form.
Expandable Seed Format: Will Always generate good encryption
GUI Interface: User-friendly graphical interface for selecting files and saving results.

## Usage
Select an Image File:

Click the "Browse" button to select the image file you want to encode or decode.
Enter Seed:
Example 1234

Transform the Image:

Click "Save Transformed Image" to encode the image with the specified Caesar cipher shifts.
Click "Save Decoded Image" to decode the image back to its original form.
Save the Result:

Choose the location to save the transformed or decoded image file.

### Error Handling
Invalid Seed Format: Ensure the seed is in the correct format (e.g., 1234). Invalid formats will display an error message.
File Selection Errors: Verify that the selected file is an image and can be read by the application.
